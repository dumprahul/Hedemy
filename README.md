# Project Title

Hedemy - Decentralized Web Learning Platform

**Project Description:**

 Hedemy is a decentralized web learning platform that empowers course creators to propose, get approval, and publish courses directly to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Learners can stake an amount of cryptocurrency to enroll in a course. Once a course is completed, half of the staked amount is rewarded to the course creator, and the remaining half is returned to the learner. This ensures that course quality is maintained and rewards both creators and learners fairly.
